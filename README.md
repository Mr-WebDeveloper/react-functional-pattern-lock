<ul>
  <li>This page is used to create a pattern lock-like design to increase security.</li>
  <li>Checking the user with email and password is an old style.</li>
  <li>
    This is a new style which makes the site more secure because the user 
  may use the same password for all their sites. 
  </li>
  <li>
      If one site of the user got hacked or the password is breached, 
  it has a high chance of the user's other sites being hacked.
  </li> 
  <li>
  To increase security and protect the user's data from hacking, 
  I'll use this pattern lock method to verify the user.  
  </li>
  
</ul>
